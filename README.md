# App Description

Description: Allows party goers to create and vote on party music playlists. The app would also suggest similar music based on the content of the playlist. This lessens the need of a DJ, and allows parties to get started anywhere and any time. Users would also be able to check the currently playing song and like/favourite those songs for later listening. Allows people to listen to music simultaneously so that they don't have to only be partying, they could be studying together or another setting, and still colaborate with music selection. Restuarants/Cafes could open up their playlists for users to submit suggestions. Allow users to see ongoing parties nearby and join one similar to their music tastes; meeting new people in the process.

Category: Music/ social Networking

# General App Attributes

Mobile: Mobile exclusive for practical purposes. The app handles all requests for music. The headphone port allows people to connect the phone to a speaker.

Story: Creates a bond between the people in the party. By allowing everyone to contribute to the playlist, users have a chance to jam out to their favorite songs without the need of a DJ.

Market: Anyone who enjoys partying or is a person who hosts parties regularly.

Habit: For regular party-goers, this app really comes into use. It can also be used in small scale and alrge scale events. Users can also use this app in their own personal friend groups.

Scope: Could start off narrow with implementing this app to college students and then expanding it to anyone who is hosting any type of parties anywhere.
