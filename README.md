### App Description
// TODO: Add App Description
- Description: Allows party goers to create and vote on party music playlists. The app would also suggest similar music based on the content of the playlist. This lessens the need of a DJ, and allows parties to get started anywhere and any time. Users would also be able to check the currently playing song and like/favourite those songs for later listening. Allows people to listen to music simultaneously so that they don't have to only be partying, they could be studying together or another setting, and still colaborate with music selection. Restuarants/Cafes could open up their playlists for users to submit suggestions. Allow users to see ongoing parties nearby and join one similar to their music tastes; meeting new people in the process.

- Category: Music/ social Networking
